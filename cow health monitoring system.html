                      <p>" As part of the dairy industry, cows play an important role in monitoring and analyzing their health status. A cloud-based analytics engine is integrated with an Internet of Things platform that integrates various sensors. Data related to the temperature, heart rate, and activity level of the cows is collected by the sensors installed on their bodies. A cloud server analyzes the collected data using machine learning algorithms using the data that has been collected. Based on the analyzed data, farmers are informed when any abnormalities are identified in the cows' health status. As a result of the proposed system, farmers are able to take timely action and prevent diseases from spreading among their cattle, thus increasing their productivity and profitability. For small and medium-sized farms, the system is cost-effective and easy to install. Currently there exist a few systems for monitoring the health and activity of cows, such as Allflex EarTag, Smartbow, and CowManager, which are common on the market. These systems attach to the ear or leg of the cows to collect data on their behavior and health. Nevertheless, there aren't many devices that can attach to the cow's delicate neck or other areas of the body. Our suggestion is a collar band that encircles the cow's neck and gathers information on the animal's activity levels and vital signs. It offers a secure, comfortable, and cutting-edge replacement that doesn't obstruct the cow's normal movements and gives farmers a better way to monitor their cows' health and wellbeing. Even while it provides a secure and pleasant method, our technology does not monitor the cow's heat cycle."</p>
